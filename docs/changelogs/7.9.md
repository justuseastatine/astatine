yes, you read that right. cobalt now lets you convert any twitter gif to an actual .gif file! (finally)
just go to settings and enable this feature :)

service improvements:
- added an option to <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/250" target="_blank">convert gifs from twitter</a> into actual .gif format. files will be bigger and lower quality, but maybe you want that.
- pinterest support has been completely redone, now all videos (<a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/160" target="_blank">and even pin.it links</a>) are supported.
- added <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/322" target="_blank">support for ok.ru</a> in case you're a russian grandma.
- now processing <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/318" target="_blank">all reddit links</a> (including old.reddit.com).
- <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/316" target="_blank">instagram live vods</a> are now supported.
- fixed a <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/289" target="_blank">rare vimeo bug</a> related to 1440p videos.

other improvements:
- ui fade in animation is no longer present if you've disabled animations.
- all images now have alt descriptions.
- cobalt html is now <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/317" target="_blank">biblically correct</a> and follows the html spec.
- lots of cleaning up.

patches since 7.8:
- shift+key <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/288" target="_blank">shortcuts are now ignored</a> if url bar is focused.
- longer soundcloud links are now supported, also catching more tiktok-related errors.
- removed mastodon from support links as that account is no longer active.
- added ability to download a specific video from multi media tweets and support for /mediaViewer links.
- fixed <a class="text-backdrop link" href="https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/309" target="_blank">modal blurriness</a> in chromium.
- minor html changes (road to biblically correct one).

lots of long-awaited updates (especially twitter gifs), hope you enjoy them and have a great day :D
